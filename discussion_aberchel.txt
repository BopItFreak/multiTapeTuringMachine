My code works by first parsing the csv file which represents a multitape turing machine, and then using the input string provided from the command line to determine if the machine accepts or rejects.
The machine can also sometimes loop, and the user can input a termination flag after the input string to reject after 50 transitions.
In order to test my program, the output logs accurately display what state the machine is currently in, and the current symbols on the tapes
the test cases I used were the machines aOrb-aberchel.csv, palindrome-aberchel.csv, and equalABC-aberchel.csv. These have 1,2, and 3 tapes respectivly. They test all the parts of the program, including the wildcard.
I have included logs of the programs running on different inputs to get different outputs.
